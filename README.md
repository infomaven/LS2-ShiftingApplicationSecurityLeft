# LeftShiftSecurity-ShiftingLeft
Resources for my talk at SeaGL 2019 on Shift Left Security testing. 

Primary audience is Devs, but this is really a pep talk for the entire team. 

Do you know of a tool or resource that is not on here? Please feel free to fork this repo and make a pull request. 

Emphasis is on Open Source and free versions of tools.
